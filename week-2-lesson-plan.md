# Week 2 Lesson Plan

## Overview

The purpose of this second workshop is for students to be introduced to the concept of styling
a webpage using stylesheets.

## Standards

By the end of this week, students should be able to...
* ...develop a deeper understanding of CSS, including knowing...
    * ...the purpose of CSS 
    * ...what its abbreviation stands for
    * ...how to link external CSS Stylesheets to their HTML page
    * ...and being able to identify critical CSS syntax
        * Selectors
        * Brackets
* ...understand the process of code-debugging
* ...understand how to correctly use booleans to search for appropriate web resources
    * Stack Overflow
    * Mozilla Developer Network
    * W3Schools

## Objectives

Before the lesson, students will perform a greeting and short activity. Then, students will "warm up" on core concepts covered from Week 1.

During the lesson, students will be introduced to...
* ...website styling
    * In-page styling (HTML `<style></style>` tag in `<head></head>`)
    * External styling (linking CSS stylesheet to HTML page)
* ...HTML

After the lesson, students will...
* ...“cool down” on the material covered
* ...culminate with a coding playground using the online game CSS Diner in order to allow experimentation with newly-acquired skills.

## Activity

Further reinforce the lessons by allotting time toward the end of the session (after the "cool down") for experimentation with
newly-learned skills through the use of free online code editors, such as [http://jsfiddle.net/](jsfiddle.net) or [https://codepen.io/](codepen.io).
