# Welcome!

Welcome to this coding club! I'm very excited that you are interested in learning website fundamentals.

## Is this club for me?

With its unique kid-friendly curriculum, this club has been curated for middle schoolers. It's great for visual learners who want to type real code (rather than drag-and-drop block code). You'll be using the same equipment and software as real developers, because learning by doing is the best kind of learning.

## Is it going to be boring?

It will definitely be anything but boring. After learning the basics of the basics, you'll reinforce your newfound skills by playing fun coding games. Plus, you'll leave with a final, shareable website project that you can show off to your friends!

## Who's teaching me?

This club will be facilitated by Riyaad Azad, who is a proficient front-end website developer, certified Android developer and alumnus of [Al Fatih Academy](http://www.alfatih.org/). He's also fluent in several markup and programming languages, and he loves photography. To learn more about him, check out his personal website at [riyaadazad.github.io](https://riyaadazad.github.io/). You can also [email him](mailto:azad.riyaad@gmail.com).

## What will I need?

Aside from being eager to learn and obtaining permission to create an online [GitHub](https://github.com) account to join GitHub Classroom, nothing else is needed. Computers will be provided to you.
