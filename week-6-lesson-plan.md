# Week 6 Lesson Plan

## Overview

The sixth and final workshop aims to show students’ mastery of core HTML and CSS concepts/syntax through the completion and sharing (distribution) of their fully-functional web sites/projects.

## Standards

By the end of this week, students will have...
* ...built their own fully-functional web site/project
* ...displayed mastery of core front-end website development skills
* ...shared their web site/project with the group

## Objectives

At the beginning of the session, students will perform a greeting and short activity. Next, students will take a "warm up" and put the finishing touches on their projects.

During the session, students will present their projects to the group.

At the end of the session, students will “cool down” on the material covered. Afterward, the group will play a final game/activity.

Cool Down Prompts Include:
* What was your project and what is the inspiration behind it?
* Rate your project
* Out of all the projects presented today, which project was your favorite? What rating would you give that project?
* What did you think of this club?
* What did you think of the club facilitator?
