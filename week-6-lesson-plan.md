# Week 6 Lesson Plan

## Overview

The sixth and final workshop aims to show students’ mastery of core HTML and CSS concepts/syntax through the completion and sharing (distribution) of their fully-functional web sites/projects.

## Standards

By the end of this week, students will have...
* ...built their own fully-functional web site/project
* ...displayed mastery of core front-end website development skills
* ...shared their web site/project with the group

## Objectives

At the beginning of the session, students will perform a greeting and short activity. Next, students will take a "warm up" and put the finishing touches on their projects.

During the session, students will present their projects to the group.

At the end of the session, students will “cool down” on the material covered. Afterward, the group will play a final game/activity.

## Activity

The day will be reinforced by allowing students presentation time to “code and tell” (share and tell) about their creations.
